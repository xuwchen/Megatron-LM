# per FP8-enabled module that is pushed to on every fp8_autocast forward call. This
# branch's current P2/P4/P5 flow only calls the encoder forward once per iteration
# (P2 builds the graph with autograd enabled and P5 calls .backward() on the same
# graph — there is no separate no_grad-forward-then-recompute pair despite an
# earlier design-doc draft describing one), so the double-push risk that motivated
# excluding "delayed" does not currently apply. It is still excluded because (a)
# amax history state is not captured by any MDP checkpoint/eval-boundary reset path,
# so cross-iteration state leaking into P0/eval hand-off is unvalidated, and (b) if
# the recompute design from the draft doc is implemented later, delayed scaling
# would need to be revisited anyway. "tensorwise" (Float8CurrentScaling),
# "blockwise" (Float8BlockScaling), and "mxfp8" (MXFP8BlockScaling) all derive scale
# directly from the current tensor with no persisted history, so none of them are
