# MDP Implementation Knowledge

This is the fast path for agents and developers working on Modality Decoupled
Parallelism (MDP). Read this file before tracing the implementation. The public
feature overview remains in [README.md](README.md); this document focuses on
code ownership, invariants, control flow, and safe extension points.

## Current baseline

- Development branch: `dev/mdp`.
- History baseline: `e0df73690`.
- The initial MDP implementation is reconstructed as eight cohesive commits.
- The implementation represented here stops at the functionality formerly
  contained through `a849b88a9`; later optimization branches are not part of
  this baseline.
- Owner-sharded pixel capture plus `all_to_all_single` is the only MDP data
  route. There is no endpoint-star pixel mode and no pixel-sharding
  compatibility switch.

When this file disagrees with code, code and tests win. Update this file in the
same commit whenever an invariant, phase, flag, support constraint, or primary
entry point changes.

## Mental model

MDP keeps the decoder's sample ownership and native PP/VPP/EP schedule intact,
but rebalances vision items across the `CP x PP` workers that belong to one
outer data-parallel decoder replica.

Each physical rank contains:

1. its normal decoder shard;
2. a complete vision encoder replica;
3. an MDP runtime coordinating data capture, planning, encoder execution, and
   cross-worker transport.

For every iteration, all workers see the same text tensors and vision metadata.
Pixel payload materialization is sharded by microbatch:

```text
pixel_owner_worker = microbatch_id % num_workers
```

Only that worker materializes the microbatch's pixels. The deterministic planner
may assign each vision item to any producer worker. One canonical bridge ledger
then drives three `all_to_all_single` phases:

```text
PIXEL:     pixel owner -> encoder producer
EMBEDDING: encoder producer -> decoder endpoint
GRADIENT:  decoder endpoint -> encoder producer
```

Local routes are copied directly; remote routes are packed into collective
buffers. Every planning-group member enters every collective, including ranks
with zero-length splits.

## Non-negotiable invariants

Preserve these unless the feature design is intentionally changed:

- MDP-off must leave the native path unchanged.
- Decoder data ownership, sampler accounting, microbatch count, LR schedule,
  PP/VPP/EP schedule, and consumed-sample accounting remain native.
- Decoder THD and vision-encoder THD are separate layouts. Never reuse decoder
  `PackedSeqParams` for the vision encoder.
- `global_item_id` is stable and unique within one planning group and
  iteration.
- Descriptors and plans are deterministic and use integer arithmetic.
- The plan digest is checked before any bridge collective; a mismatch can
  otherwise become a distributed hang.
- The plan is the single source of truth for pixel, embedding, and gradient
  routes.
- Pixel ownership is always derived from the microbatch ID. It is not a user
  option.
- Every bridge phase uses `all_to_all_single`; do not add a second P2P
  transport.
- Empty workers and text-only microbatches still participate in group and WORLD
  collectives.
- Encoder and decoder parameter sets are disjoint.
- Encoder gradients are reduced over WORLD and normalized with the decoder
  finalizer's in-place-reduced global token count.
- Decoder DDP overlap stays inside the native decoder schedule. The encoder
  uses an independent synchronous DDP configuration for its P5/P6 lifecycle.
- The composite optimizer treats decoder and encoder overflow, norm clipping,
  and step success as one atomic decision.
- MDP-owned buffers must be allocated through `MdpBufferAllocator`.

## Phase machine

`MdpRuntime` has three externally visible states:

```text
EMPTY -> DECODER_READY -> DECODER_DONE -> EMPTY
```

The iteration phases are:

| Phase | Main implementation | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | `MdpRuntime.begin_iteration` | Reset iteration state and encoder gradients. |
| P1 | `window.py`, `groups.py`, `planner.py`, `bridge.py` | Capture the full iteration, shard pixel reads, broadcast descriptors, build/check the plan, and route pixels. |
| P2 | `runtime.py`, `activation.py`, model adapter | Pack producer chunks. Default training runs the encoder with autograd; complete-encoder recompute runs it under `no_grad` and saves pixels/layouts/output metadata/RNG recipes. |
| P3 | `bridge.py`, `storage.py` | Route detached vision embeddings to decoder endpoints and create endpoint leaves. |
| P4 | Native Megatron schedule | Replay captured microbatches through the unchanged decoder schedule, finish any native decoder gradient-reduce overlap, and capture global token count. |
| P5 | `runtime.py`, `activation.py`, `encoder.py` | Route leaf gradients back; run retained-graph backward or replay complete encoder chunks with restored RNG before backward; reduce WORLD gradients and normalize them. |
| P6 | `optimizer.py` | Union overflow state, compute a combined norm, clip consistently, and step decoder plus encoder optimizers. |

Evaluation runs P0-P4, skips autograd/backward, releases retained state, and
returns to `EMPTY`.

### Megatron training seams

- `megatron/training/training.py`: creates the MDP domain and wraps train/eval
  schedules.
- `megatron/training/checkpointing.py`: injects MDP vision state into the
  distributed checkpoint on save and restores it on load.
- `megatron/training/arguments.py`: permits the validated TE
  cross-entropy-fusion baseline used by the reference launcher.

## Data contract

The collator builds normal decoder tensors plus an MDP vision sidecar:

- `vision_item_meta`: per-item sample, ordinal, `(t,h,w)`, and payload start;
- `vision_decoder_positions`: absolute image-token positions in the decoder's
  packed physical layout;
- `pixel_values`: present only on the owner worker for that microbatch;
- `image_grid_thw`: present on all workers and used to derive item shapes;
- `flops_cu_seqlens`: present only under `--thd-static-packing`; the
  pre-tail-pad valid `cu_seqlens`, because the static tail is represented as an
  ordinary dummy sequence and would otherwise inflate the FLOPs accumulator.

Under `--thd-static-packing` the tail policy is always `append_dummy_seq`:
`ModelParallelConfig` rejects `extend_last` with static packing at every CP
size, and `build_static_thd_metadata` no longer implements it. `extend_last`
leaves `cu_seqlens_q` ending at the real token count while the tensors are
padded to the static target; TE then returns a shorter attention output than
the padded input. `pad_between_seqs` is derived
from the collator's row alignment (`divisible_by > 1`), not hardcoded to
`True`: at TP=CP=1 no sample is ever padded, so there is provably no gap, and
claiming otherwise makes FlashAttention ineligible and can drop TE onto its
unfused O(T^2) backend.

`MdpModelAdapter.get_batch` converts the model-specific batch into
`CapturedMicrobatch`. Core MDP treats `model_payload` as opaque and consumes
only the explicit vision carrier types.

Validation happens before distributed transport:

- pixels and grid metadata are consistent;
- payload rows equal `sum(t*h*w)`;
- decoder image-token slots equal post-merge vision output rows;
- item intervals do not overlap or exceed the flat pixel payload;
- decoder packed format is THD;
- item ordering is deterministic.

## Planning and routing

`MdpPlanner` sorts descriptors by descending integer cost and ascending item
ID, then assigns them with deterministic LPT. `--mdp-pixel-locality` changes
only the tie/preference inside the configured slack window; it must not violate
the load eligibility rule.

The plan contains:

- logical producer assignment;
- owner worker for the PIXEL source;
- endpoint rank for EMBEDDING/GRADIENT;
- producer encoder THD layouts;
- decoder microbatch leaf layouts;
- a 16-byte deterministic digest.

Capacity padding affects allocations only. Segment offsets accumulate valid
rows, and attention frame boundaries are derived from `grid_thw`.

## Runtime and prefetch

`--mdp-overlap-window-capture` captures the next training window on a
background thread and a dedicated CUDA stream. The consumer waits on a CUDA
event, not a host synchronization, and records captured tensors on the main
stream before use.

The prefetch path is keyed by iterator identity. Evaluation does not consume a
pending training window. Any change to captured tensor ownership must update the
`record_stream` traversal in `runtime.py`.

The collator also uses a pinned single-buffer path, and bridge receives can land
directly in final consumer views. Preserve those destination-view contracts
when changing payload shapes.

## Optimizer and checkpoint semantics

The vision encoder is replicated over WORLD and uses its own DDP/ZeRO-1 domain.
The decoder retains its native dense/expert optimizer domains.

`MdpChainedOptimizer` coordinates all members:

- overflow is unioned with WORLD MAX before scaler updates;
- norm clipping uses one combined norm;
- all members either step or skip together;
- LR scheduler binding sees the composite optimizer.

The native decoder may enable `overlap_grad_reduce` and
`overlap_param_gather`. Its DDP hooks and pipeline schedule retain ownership of
those operations: decoder gradient communication is drained by the native P4
finalizer, and decoder parameter all-gathers are dispatched/waited by the
native forward path. The encoder DDP config is a copy with both overlap modes
disabled, so its WORLD gradient reduction and parameter synchronization remain
synchronous in P5/P6. Delayed gradient reduction and
`overlap_param_gather_with_optimizer_step` remain unsupported because they
cross that phase/domain boundary.

The current checkpoint support is intentionally narrow:

- synchronous global `torch_dist`;
- vision weights stored under the MDP vision key, saved and loaded through the
  MDP facade;
- composite optimizer state for both domains, with the encoder member under a
  fixed key so the decoder DP-CP and encoder WORLD sharding domains never
  collide (both otherwise compute `data_parallel_group_idx == 0`);
- unsupported save/load modes are rejected at startup.

Decoder and WORLD encoder optimizers do not share a DP sharding group; never
key or reshard them as if they did.

## FP8 and quantized-GEMM alignment

Decoder and encoder FP8 are configured separately. `args.fp8` reaches only the
decoder; the vision `TransformerConfig` is built by the adapter and never reads
it, and the typed encoder arguments (`--encoder-recompute-*`) carry no FP8
field. Decoder FP8 is not an MDP incompatibility, so `MdpCompatibilityOptions`
carries no field for it at all; the one thing it asks of MDP, the THD row
alignment, reads `args.fp8` directly in `forward_step.py`.

Encoder FP8 is rejected where it becomes observable rather than inferred from
args: `validate_effective_vision_config` runs on the resolved vision config
inside `build_encoder_domain` and refuses `fp8 is not None`. A future adapter
that wires FP8 into the vision config trips that check instead of silently
training an FP8 encoder the support matrix never validated.

Quantized GEMMs constrain the decoder's packed row count: `pack_or_pad_batch`
extends the last sample's padded region until the packed total is a multiple of
`get_fp8_align_size(fp8_recipe)` (32 for MXFP8, 16 otherwise). Every other
sample keeps its exact length, which is what lets that call site declare
`pad_between_seqs=False` and keep FlashAttention/FusedAttention eligible for
THD. Alignments it cannot derive fail loudly instead: with
`--use-packed-sequence`, `--fp4-format` and `--fp8-recipe custom` raise
`NotImplementedError`. Without `--use-packed-sequence` it contributes nothing:
BSHD collation is untouched by FP8. Under MDP that branch is unreachable (MDP
requires packed sequences); natively it is reachable and, exactly as on base,
unguarded -- a BSHD + FP8 run outside MDP gets no alignment from this stack.

### Decoder packed-row alignment: derivation

Where the requirement lands. Quantized GEMMs check the tensor as the layer
receives it, which is the rank-local one. CP has already taken its `1/cp_size`
slice. Under sequence parallelism a column-parallel layer is still holding its
`1/tp_size` shard when the check runs: `transformer_engine/pytorch/module/
layernorm_linear.py` calls `assert_dim_for_fp8_exec` on the input before the
sequence-parallel `gather_along_first_dim`, and quantizes that same shard
(MXFP8's `flat_first_dim % 32` check in `csrc/quantizer.cpp` sees it too). So
the collated multiple is `lcm(divisible_by, pad_to_multiple * cp_size *
(tp_size if SP else 1))`, where `divisible_by` is the parallelism-only
requirement (`tp_size` under SP, `cp_size * 2` under CP, their product with
both). The 8/16/32 sources: `assert_dim_for_fp8_exec` needs the leading dim
divisible by 8, the backward wgrad GEMM (`cublaslt_gemm.cu`
`CanonicalizeGemmInput`) needs 16, and MXFP8's `create_tensor` needs 32;
`megatron.core.fp8_utils.get_fp8_align_size` returns 32 for MXFP8 and 16
otherwise.

Why tail-only at `cp_size == 1`. Without CP the total is the only thing that
has to be aligned: SP scatters the `[T, 1, H]` tensor as a unit
(`scatter_to_sequence_parallel_region` in `models/base.py`), and the `tp_size`
factor above already lifted the quantized-GEMM requirement onto that same total.
Neither constrains per-sample boundaries. Rounding every sample up would open
literal inter-sample gaps (`[a, a, PAD, b, b, b, PAD, c, PAD]`) that TE's THD
attention detects as `pad_between_seqs=True` and answers by disabling
FlashAttention/FusedAttention in favour of `UnfusedDotProductAttention` -- a
~72% throughput regression measured on decoder FP8. So the samples are packed
back to back and the whole tail is absorbed once by extending the last sample's
padded region, the shape `megatron/core/packed_seq_params.py` calls
"extend_last". `cu_seqlens[:-1] == cu_seqlens_padded[:-1]` is asserted.

Why CP keeps per-sample alignment. TE partitions each sample on its own, so
per-sample alignment is mandatory under CP whether or not FP8 is on, and the
same `divisible_by` is applied to every sample. That is the tightest *uniform*
per-sample rule that forces every rank's local row count to be a multiple of
`pad_to_multiple` (a microbatch can hold a single sample). It is strict --
up to `divisible_by - 1` padded rows per sample, 256 at `cp_size=8` with MXFP8
and no SP. A total-only variant would be tighter and is not written because
MDP rejects CP > 1 outright.

Why `pad_between_seqs=False` is declared, and when it would be wrong. Declaring
it lets `TEDotProductAttention.forward()`
(`megatron/core/extensions/transformer_engine.py`) pass `cu_seqlens_q_padded`
as the effective attention boundary while `cu_seqlens_q` and `padding_mask`
stay exact for loss and routing. This deliberately diverges from
`pad_sequence_for_thd` in `packed_seq_params.py`, which reports `True` for the
identical "extend_last" layout -- the conservative answer a helper that cannot
see how its input was built has to give, and one the call site that built the
layout does not have to inherit. It is safe only because the decoder mask is
causal: the tail rows follow every real row of the last sequence, so no real
query reads them, and their own outputs are discarded by `loss_mask=0` /
`labels=-100`. The collate function never sees an `attn_mask_type`, so the
premise is owned by the decoder spec: `models/qwen35_vl/specs.py` delegates to
`get_transformer_block_with_experimental_attention_variant_spec`, whose
full-attention layers come from `get_gpt_layer_with_transformer_engine_spec`
with a hard-coded `attn_mask_type=AttnMaskType.causal` and whose
gated-delta-net layers are a causal recurrence; neither exposes a knob. Whoever
adds a non-causal decoder spec owns dropping the flag (or padding every sample).

### Buffered first-fit decreasing packing

`--mdp-ffd-packing` selects FFD instead of `--mdp-greedy-packing`; the two flags
are mutually exclusive. `--mdp-ffd-packing-buffer-size` (default 128, positive)
sets the number of complete samples read into each sorting window. Sort by
aligned decoder length descending, breaking ties by source order; place each
sample into the first bin in creation order satisfying the token budget and
real-sequence cap. Before each subsequent bin, refill the slots freed by the
previous emission into a separate reading window, keeping reading plus pending
samples within the configured buffer size. This matches Energon's refill cadence
and lets loader workers replenish continuously. Form the next window's bins only
after the current bins drain. At EOF emit all pending and partial-window bins. No sample or image is truncated,
dropped, duplicated, or moved between DP replicas.

This follows Energon's buffered select-then-pack interface; Energon itself
leaves grouping to the task encoder. The existing multimodal task encoder's
`greedy_knapsack` is a descending knapsack fill, not an API provided by Energon.
The FFD stream has no Energon runtime dependency.

The entry point follows the greedy/static separation introduced in PR #48:

| Grouping policy | CLI selection | Variable THD shape | Fixed THD shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed sample count | Neither MDP packing flag | Default | Add `--thd-static-packing` |
| In-order greedy | `--mdp-greedy-packing` | Supported | Add `--thd-static-packing` |
| Buffered FFD | `--mdp-ffd-packing` | Supported | Add `--thd-static-packing` |

Static THD controls the collator's output shape; it does not choose the grouping
algorithm. Its existing alignment, token-budget and dummy-tail requirements
still apply. `--mdp-overlap-window-capture` is independent of both controls.
Both policies enter through `add_multimodal_args`, `mdp_config_from_args` and
`maybe_build_mdp_domain`; only the sample-stream implementation differs.
Internal `greedy_*` helper and runtime field names are retained for compatibility
and now serve both token-budget policies. The collator is unchanged.

Both policies use `MdpConfig.packing_enabled` for validation, stream capture and
sample accounting. `PackedSampleStream` owns source-list buffering and commits;
`GreedySampleStream` and `FfdSampleStream` own grouping. Reading an FFD window
is not consumption: only emitted bins increment `drained_samples`, and only
installed iteration windows commit them. Pending FFD bins survive iteration
boundaries and keep `exhausted` false even after the source reaches EOF.

All greedy restrictions below apply equally to FFD: fixed bin-count MBS/GBS,
real all-reduced committed sample counts, independent static THD shape, reserved
dummy tail slot, no sample-based training/rampup, and no exact resume.
`--mdp-packing-approximate-resume` is a policy-neutral alias for the existing
`--mdp-greedy-packing-approximate-resume`; either explicitly accepts approximate
resume with either policy. FFD additionally retains decoded image payloads in
its bounded window; the bound is in samples, not bytes, and excludes loader
prefetch/current source list. Provision host memory accordingly.

For performance comparisons, use identical dataset/sampler settings, token
budget, model and topology. Report useful tokens/s, records/s, fill ratio and
iteration time together. A higher fill ratio increases useful work per step;
iteration time alone does not compare packing throughput. FFD reorders complete
samples, so per-step loss and visual workload need not match greedy.

Packing flags MDP consumes from the core config (all optional, all off by
default):

- `--max-seqlen-per-dp-cp-rank` -- required by `--mdp-greedy-packing`; the
  greedy token budget is this times `context_parallel_size`.
- `--thd-max-packed-sequences` -- caps real sequences per bin, and fixes the
  `cu_seqlens` entry count under `--thd-static-packing`. The static padding tail
  occupies one of those slots, so it must exceed the real sequences a microbatch
  can hold: `greedy_max_real_sequences()` reserves the slot for greedy bins, and
  `validate_mdp_config` requires
  `>= max(micro_batch_size, eval_micro_batch_size) + 1` without greedy packing.
- `--thd-static-packing` -- the data path emits fixed-shape THD batches
  (`T == max_seqlen_per_dp_cp_rank * cp_size`, `cu_seqlens*` of
  `thd_max_packed_sequences + 1` entries). Requires
  `--pad-packed-seq-alignment max` and the `append_dummy_seq` tail policy
  (`extend_last` is rejected at every CP size). Independent of
  `--mdp-greedy-packing`: all four corners of the 2x2 are reachable.
- `--sequence-packing-scheduler` is **rejected** under MDP. It is not merely
  untested: `training.py` wraps the data iterator whenever it is set, and
  `DpBalancedScheduler.run` then asserts on GPT-only sample keys, deletes every
  key outside those six (dropping `pixel_values` / `image_grid_thw`), and
  reroutes samples across DP with an all-to-all that has no notion of
  variable-size pixel payloads. MDP owns its packing instead.

`--mdp-greedy-packing` **reinterprets** `--micro-batch-size` and
`--global-batch-size`: they no longer describe what goes into a microbatch,
only how many bins an iteration has (`N = GBS / (MBS x DP)`). Two consequences
to state in any comparison:

- GBS means "N x token budget", so loss curves are not iteration-by-iteration
  comparable against a fixed-GBS run;
- DP ranks consume different sample counts, so `consumed_train_samples` is
  computed from a real all-reduced count
  (`training._mdp_greedy_consumed_samples`) rather than the closed form. Samples
  are counted when the window built from them is installed for its iteration,
  not when they are drained -- under `--mdp-overlap-window-capture` the prefetch
  thread fills the next iteration's window during the current one, and the final
  prefetch is dropped unconsumed.
- Checkpointing is **rejected** with greedy packing unless
  `--mdp-greedy-packing-approximate-resume` is passed: the cross-iteration
  sample buffer is not checkpointed, and `MegatronPretrainingSampler` is
  positioned from one global `consumed_train_samples` that cannot express the
  per-DP-rank drain counts greedy packing produces, so a resume may skip or
  repeat samples. Greedy packing is a benchmarking path today.
- `--train-samples` and `--rampup-batch-size` are **rejected** with greedy
  packing, because both read samples-per-iteration as a constant exchange rate.
  `train_iters = train_samples // GBS` (`training.py`) would silently train on
  about `train_samples x k / MBS` real samples for a data-dependent `k`, and
  `update_num_microbatches(consumed_train_samples)` now consumes the real count
  while the rampup thresholds stay nominal, so the batch size would ramp
  `k / MBS` times too fast. `--lr-decay-samples` / `--lr-warmup-samples` are
  covered by the `--train-samples` rejection (`validate_args` only admits them
  in that branch); the LR/WD schedules themselves are unaffected, since
  `opt_param_scheduler` still steps by the nominal GBS, so the same bad rate
  divides and multiplies back out.

The stream must be provisioned by **tokens**, not samples: an iteration eats
about `token_budget / mean_sample_len` samples per bin, so
`train_iters x GBS` under-provisions whenever the mean sample is shorter than
`token_budget / MBS`. The mock provider scales its dataset accordingly
(`mdp_mock._greedy_sample_scale`); a real dataset must be sized by the
operator.

The typed encoder recompute arguments are shared by native `multimodal_dev` and
MDP training. Native training supports no recompute, `selective`, and `full`;
`whole` is MDP-only because it relies on the P2/P5 replay protocol. With no
encoder granularity, the native path keeps normal encoder activations and MDP
P2 retains the normal graph-connected encoder outputs.

`selective` and `full` use MCore's native Transformer checkpointing. The
typed encoder arguments are copied to the vision `TransformerConfig` through
`dataclasses.replace`, so MCore's own field and cross-field validation remains
authoritative. `selective` accepts `--encoder-recompute-modules`; `full`
uses `--encoder-recompute-method` and
`--encoder-recompute-num-layers`. Here `full` retains MCore's established
meaning: checkpoint complete Transformer layers or layer groups, not the
complete vision encoder.

`--encoder-recompute-granularity whole` follows the original MDP design: P2
runs patch embedding, positions/RoPE, all Transformer layers, and the patch
merger under `no_grad`; the producer retains valid packed pixels, immutable
chunk layouts, P2 output metadata, and CPU/CUDA/model-parallel RNG state per
chunk. In P5 it forks the ambient RNG, restores each chunk's P2 state, replays
the complete encoder with gradients enabled, immediately backpropagates the
routed output gradient, and finally restores the P5-entry RNG.
Chunk-at-a-time replay makes `encoder_max_payload_rows` bound the rebuilt
graph, but not all live state: every producer's packed pixels survive across
P4, and P5 materializes all routed chunk-output gradients before the first
replay. The initial P5 peak is therefore all retained pixels plus all routed
gradients plus one chunk's activation graph. Consumed pixel and gradient
references are dropped after each chunk backward, so their live storage
decreases through P5, but this does not reduce that initial peak. Smaller
chunks reduce only the rebuilt-graph term and add more serial replay/backward
launches.

Whole replay adds one full encoder forward: encoder forward FLOPs are
approximately doubled, while encoder backward still runs once. Prefer native
`selective` or `full` Transformer recompute when checkpointing Transformer
activations saves enough memory; use `whole` when the additional patch
embedding, position/RoPE, and patch-merger activation savings justify replaying
the complete encoder. `whole` rejects native Transformer recompute on the
effective vision config, including config supplied directly by an adapter,
because nesting the mechanisms would replay the vision Transformer twice in
P5.

There is deliberately no pixel-sharding flag. Pixel owner sharding is part of
the MDP definition in this baseline.

  while delayed gradient reduction, parameter-gather overlap with the optimizer
  step, and MXFP8 grad-buffer reuse for the parameter all-gather are rejected by
  `validate_mdp_config`;
- no `--sequence-packing-scheduler`; MDP owns its packing, and
  `--mdp-greedy-packing` additionally rejects `--train-samples` and
  `--rampup-batch-size`.

Always read `validate_mdp_config` before relaxing a constraint. A validation
change without corresponding runtime/test support is not an implementation.

## Metrics and observability

MDP NVTX ranges use the `mdp.` namespace; native multimodal comparison ranges
use `mm.`. The important coarse ranges correspond to capture, planning, pixel
dispatch, encoder forward/backward, embedding/gradient exchange, and leaf
assembly.

FLOP accounting is intentionally generic multimodal functionality, not MDP
functionality:

- Text-only microbatches report zero vision statistics, not an absent report.
  Otherwise a DP replica with no vision work skips the WORLD stats collective
  while other replicas enter it.
- real THD `cu_seqlens` supply packed token statistics;
- vision patch, attention, MLP, and merger FLOPs are added from replicated grid
  metadata;
- native and MDP paths publish equivalent statistics.

Do not put new generic multimodal metric code under an `mdp_enable` gate unless
the metric is genuinely MDP-specific.

## Verification entry points

Pure-compute and CPU-oriented tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_config.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_rank_mapping.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_plan.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_planner.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_window.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_quantized_alignment.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_pinned_collate.py
```

Distributed MDP transport/runtime tests:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 -m pytest -q \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_groups.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_bridge.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_pixel_owner_shard.py \
  tests/unit_tests/mdp/test_runtime.py
```

Model-side contract and parity tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q examples/multimodal_dev/tests/test_mdp_dataset.py
# pack_or_pad_batch ends in a TP broadcast, so this one needs a rank:
torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 -m pytest -q \
  examples/multimodal_dev/tests/test_thd_e2e.py
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 -m pytest -q \
  examples/multimodal_dev/tests/test_mdp_parity.py
```

Reference launcher:

```bash
MDP=1 OVERLAP=1 PIXEL_LOCALITY=1 \
  bash examples/multimodal_dev/scripts/run_mdp_experiments.sh
```

Use `MDP=0` for the native comparison. Set `NSYS=1 OUT=<basename>` for an
NVTX/CUDA timeline. The launcher supports multi-node rendezvous through
`NNODES`, `NODE_RANK`, `MASTER_ADDR`, and `MASTER_PORT`.

## Change routing guide

Start investigation here:

- data/collation or missing pixels: `forward_step.py` -> `mdp_adapter.py` ->
  `window.py`;
- rank/group bug: `rank_mapping.py` -> `groups.py`;
- imbalance or locality: `protocols.py` cost -> `planner.py` -> plan digest;
- wrong payload destination: `plan.py` -> `bridge.py` -> runtime destination
  views;
- autograd/loss mismatch: `storage.py` -> `runtime.py` P3/P5 ->
  `activation.py` -> `encoder.py`;
- skipped or inconsistent update: `optimizer.py`;
- startup rejection: `integration.py` snapshot -> `config.py`;
- checkpoint issue: `checkpoint.py` -> `training/checkpointing.py`;
- throughput metric issue: generic code in `forward_step.py` and
  `training.py`, not the MDP planner/bridge.

## Common failure modes

- A plan mismatch often appears as a collective hang if the digest check is
  bypassed. Never disable the check to get a run through.
- Every worker must consume the same number of microbatches during capture even
  though only owners materialize pixels.
- Descriptor schema changes require synchronized updates to serialization,
  deserialization, digest inputs, and tests.
- Floating-point planner costs can diverge across ranks. Planner inputs and
  comparisons must remain integer.
- A text-only microbatch has no vision descriptor, route, leaf, or encoder work,
  but it remains in decoder replay.
- Background capture must not enqueue work on the main compute stream.
- Host reads such as `.item()`, `.tolist()`, or implicit tensor formatting
  in the iteration hot path can serialize GPU work.
- An all-to-all rank with no local items still calls the collective with zero
  split sizes.
- Native-path instrumentation must not wrap or mutate tensors in a way that
  changes PP send-buffer or autograd contracts.

## Extension checklist

Before landing a new capability:

1. update the support matrix and remove only the validation that is now truly
   implemented;
2. identify affected rank, plan, carrier, and checkpoint schemas;
3. keep the native MDP-off path side-effect free;
4. add pure tests for deterministic transforms;
5. add distributed tests for every new collective/rank topology;
6. compare loss and gradient norm against the current reference;
7. report iteration time and all-rank peak allocated/reserved memory;
8. update this file and README when the mental model or entry points change.


## Static dummy-tail segmentation

The multimodal static-THD collator accepts `--thd-dummy-seq-length N`, a
preferred maximum **global** dummy sequence length (for example, 8192).
Without this option it appends one dummy sequence as before. With the option,
it splits only the physical padding tail into balanced independent sequences,
reducing the full-attention sum-of-squared-lengths cost of a long tail.

This is shared by fixed-count, greedy and FFD grouping. It changes no sample
assignment, real sequence boundary, token/label/mask/pixel tensor, fixed THD
shape or real-token/FLOPs counter. The original one-dummy-slot reservation is
unchanged: segmentation uses spare sequence slots, and can exceed N if those
slots are insufficient. Thus N is a target, not an admission limit. Increasing
`thd_max_packed_sequences` separately can change packing/sampler behavior and
must not be mixed into a same-work segmentation comparison.

At CP>1, lengths respect the global CP partition quantum (2*CP for zigzag,
CP for contiguous); N is rounded down to this quantum and cannot be smaller
than it. This does not expand MDP's supported parallelism matrix. The option
requires static THD, retains `append_dummy_seq`, and keeps the conservative
static `max_seqlen` bound. It does not eliminate dense/GDN padding-row work.

Segmentation is limited to dropless, non-Sinkhorn MoE routing. Capacity-based
token dropping or Sinkhorn normalization can couple changed dummy activations
to real-token routing, so TransformerConfig rejects those combinations. The
multimodal padding mask continues to exclude padding from router auxiliary
losses. Numerical checks use zero dropout, as in the measured training recipe.
