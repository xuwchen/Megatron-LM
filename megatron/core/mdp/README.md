# MDP — Modality Decoupled Parallelism

MDP addresses GPU stalls caused by long-tail vision workloads in multimodal
training. It does not change sample ownership or decoder data-parallel
semantics: every physical rank co-locates a complete (replicated) vision
encoder with its language-decoder shard, and each iteration's visual items are
rebalanced across the `CP x PP` encoder workers inside each decoder replica.
The native decoder PP/VPP/EP schedule, sampler, microbatch, LR, and
consumed-sample accounting run unchanged.

Enable with `--mdp-enable` in a training entry point that registers an
`MdpModelAdapter` (see `examples/multimodal_dev`). With the flag absent, every
integration point is side-effect free and `finalize_model_grads_func` stays
unwrapped.

For an agent-oriented implementation map, invariants, extension guide, and
verification commands, see [`knowledge.md`](knowledge.md).

## Phase machine

The runtime exposes three states (`EMPTY -> DECODER_READY -> DECODER_DONE ->
EMPTY`) driving seven phases:

| Phase | Where | Action |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | `begin_iteration` | Zero encoder grads, reset iteration state |
| P1 | `begin_iteration` | Capture the iteration window, broadcast fixed-width descriptors from the PP0 endpoint, run deterministic LPT to logical workers, check the plan digest across the group, exchange pixels |
| P2 | `begin_iteration` | Chunked encoder forward on encoder THD. Default training retains graph-connected outputs; `--encoder-recompute-granularity whole` runs under `no_grad` and retains pixels/layouts/RNG recipes; evaluation retains neither graph nor recipe |
| P3 | `begin_iteration` | Exchange detached embeddings; endpoint assembles one detached leaf per vision-bearing microbatch |
| P4 | native schedule | Replay iterators feed the unmodified decoder schedule; the wrapped `finalize_model_grads_func` captures the in-place-reduced global token count |
| P5 | `end_iteration` | Exchange leaf gradients back; default mode runs one multi-tensor backward (native MCore Transformer recompute replays here), while `whole` restores RNG and replays complete encoder chunks one by one before backward; WORLD sum-reduce with prescale 1, scale by `1/clamp(T_global, 1)` |
| P6 | composite optimizer | WORLD MAX overflow union before any scaler update, combined-norm shared clipping, one atomic step for `[decoder_dense, decoder_expert?, encoder]` |

Key contracts: encoder and decoder THD packings are fully separate (linked
only by `global_item_id`, `(microbatch, sample, ordinal)` and exact row
counts, plus endpoint-local `decoder_positions`); one plan is the single
source of truth for pixel dispatch, embedding return, and reverse gradient
routing; pixels never enter the decoder; the encoder never enters the decoder
schedule model list.

## Support matrix (v1)

Supported: Qwen3.5-VL (one vision encoder), `TP=1`, decoder `CP>=1`
(`cp_partition_mode=zigzag`), `encoder_cp=1`, native PP/VPP/EP, fully replicated encoder with WORLD ZeRO-1,
`calculate_per_token_loss=True`, bf16 main path (fp16 covered by
overflow-union tests), THD packed sequences on both sides, native MCore vision
Transformer recompute (`selective`/`full`) or Design-Doc whole-encoder replay
(`--encoder-recompute-granularity whole`), text-only microbatches, synchronous
global `torch_dist` checkpoints with exact resume (model, optimizer,
LR-scheduler and RNG state at the same world size), `alignment_rows=1` (tests
exercise 16), and native decoder DDP
`overlap_grad_reduce`/`overlap_param_gather`. Decoder overlap remains owned by
the native PP/VPP schedule; the separate encoder DDP domain stays synchronous
in P5/P6. Decoder-only EP A2A overlap via
`--overlap-moe-expert-parallel-comm --delay-wgrad-compute` is supported with
the native MCore requirements (`EP>1`, and VPP when `PP>1`); the vision encoder
remains outside that schedule.

Decoder FP8 is supported. The decoder uses the native `--fp8`/`--fp8-recipe`
flags; the vision `TransformerConfig` is built separately by the model adapter
and never inherits them, so decoder FP8 leaves the encoder domain untouched
(`validate_effective_vision_config` re-asserts that against the resolved vision
config inside `build_encoder_domain`). Its one requirement falls on the collated
decoder sequence: quantized GEMMs need the packed row count to be a multiple of
`get_fp8_align_size(fp8_recipe)` (32 for MXFP8, 16 otherwise), which
`pack_or_pad_batch` in `examples/multimodal_dev/forward_step.py` supplies by
extending the last sample's padded region. Alignments that call site cannot
derive fail loudly instead: with `--use-packed-sequence`, `--fp4-format` and
`--fp8-recipe custom` raise `NotImplementedError`.

Rejected at startup: FSDP/HSDP, encoder FP8, full-iteration CUDA graphs, CPU
activation offload, delayed gradient reduction,
`overlap_param_gather_with_optimizer_step`,
`reuse_grad_buf_for_mxfp8_param_ag`, multiple distributed-optimizer
instances, `calculate_per_token_loss=False`, non-`torch_dist` checkpoint
formats, fully-parallel / asynchronous / non-persistent / constant-structure
checkpoint modes, invalid rank mappings.

### Checkpoint support matrix

Every "supported" row below was measured on 4x GB300 with the tiny MDP proxy
(4 decoder layers, 8 experts top-2, 2 vision layers, seq 1024, GBS 8, seed
1234), `--ckpt-format torch_dist --no-ckpt-fully-parallel-save`. Deltas are
against the trajectory the checkpoint was taken from; the run-to-run floor for
this shape is ~8.6e-2 in grad norm.

| Scenario | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| MDP -> MDP, identical parallel layout, full resume (model + optimizer + LR scheduler + RNG) | **Supported** | Resumed iterations reproduce the reference at d=0.000E+00 except one iteration at 4.6e-3, inside the floor |
| Cross-PP restart, weights only (`--no-load-optim`) | **Supported** | PP=2 save -> PP=4 load: the first resumed iteration matches the PP=2 source exactly in loss *and* grad norm; later iterations drift as expected without optimizer state |
| Cross-PP restart **with** optimizer state, saved with `--dist-ckpt-optim-fully-reshardable` | **Supported** | Same save/load pair tracks the source to 1e-3 grad norm and 1.2e-4 loss -- two orders tighter than weight-only, and tighter than the floor |
| Cross-PP restart with optimizer state, checkpoint saved with the defaults | **Rejected, by design** | Upstream raises before training starts (`distrib_optim_sharding_type == 'dp_reshardable'`). The flag is a **save-time** decision; a checkpoint already written without it can only be restarted weight-only. Note the upstream message names `--ckpt-fully-parallel-save`, which is a different flag and is itself rejected under MDP |
| Checkpoint missing encoder weights (e.g. a non-strict `--dist-ckpt-strictness` dropped them) | **Rejected, loudly** | `load_encoder_state` raises `MdpCheckpointError` instead of resuming from the random initialization |
| TransformerEngine `_extra_state` drift between the checkpoint and the running TE | **Tolerated** | The delegated load retries non-strictly, matching what `load_model_state_dict` gives every decoder chunk |
| Cross-TP / cross-EP / cross-CP restart, and changing the world size | **Untested** | Only the pipeline dimension was moved; no claim either way. Note that at `TP=PP=1, CP>1` the decoder and the WORLD encoder optimizer both shard over WORLD-sized groups and both compute `data_parallel_group_idx == 0`, which is exactly the collision the encoder's fixed key exists to prevent -- that topology has no end-to-end save/load coverage |
| native (non-MDP) checkpoint -> MDP, or MDP -> native | **Not supported** | Decoder keys line up, but the encoder is saved through its DDP wrapper and carries an extra `module.` level (`vision_model.module.<param>` vs `vision_model.<param>`) |
| Fully-parallel save/load, asynchronous, non-persistent, constant-structure caching, non-`torch_dist` formats | **Rejected at startup** | `assert_supported_checkpoint_config` and `validate_mdp_config` |

Whole-encoder replay is deliberately exclusive with native vision
`TransformerConfig` recompute. Nesting the two would add a third vision
forward in P5 and obscure both the memory and compute contract.

`encoder_max_payload_rows` caps one rebuilt activation graph, not the complete
P5 footprint. Producers retain all packed pixels across P4, and P5 materializes
all routed chunk-output gradients before replay begins, so the initial peak is
all pixels plus all output gradients plus one chunk's activation graph.
Processed pixel and gradient references are dropped after each chunk backward;
smaller chunks reduce the graph term but add serial replay/backward launches.

Complete replay adds one full encoder forward, approximately doubling encoder
forward FLOPs while leaving encoder backward at one execution. Prefer native
`selective` or `full` Transformer recompute when its memory savings are enough;
use complete replay when saving patch embedding, position/RoPE, and patch-merger
activations justifies the extra complete forward.

Decoder CP is implemented: an item's decoder rows are split across the
pipeline-stage-0 ranks with the integer inverse of TransformerEngine's zigzag
partition (`megatron/core/mdp/cp_partition.py`), and each endpoint receives only
its own rows. Nothing is replicated and no gradient is reduced across CP. See
the "Decoder context parallelism" section of `knowledge.md`.

Registered extension hooks (each exercised by a test at a non-degenerate
value): logical workers + `worker_ranks()` for encoder CP, the typed encoder
configuration + row-capacity policy for encoder FP8, and the unified buffer
allocator for full-iteration CUDA graphs. The hooks guarantee no breaking
schema change is needed later; they do not mean the capability is implemented.
